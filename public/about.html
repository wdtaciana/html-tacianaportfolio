<p>My name is Taciana Pessoa, I was born in 1998 and I'm Brazilian.</p>
<p>I've always loved traveling and getting to know new cultures. When I was 13, I lived in Spain, which opened my mind to other languages and a culture very different from my own.
<p>I returned to Brazil where I studied Spanish at university to become a language teacher. In 2020 I met a place that changed my life, the Lagarto na banana hostel. This place introduced me to great surprises in my life, including my current partner. I learned fluent English and many things about other languages. I also started leading the team as site manager after a year.</p> 
<p>After I met my current partner, I became interested in other languages, programming languages and now I'm in love with this path and want to keep going.</p>
